# *Awesome* Python for Data Science

**The Data-Centric AI Community is the home of all things data 🐍**

This repository was created by our community members to build a curated list of awesome resources such books, tutorials, courses, open-source libraries, exercises and other materials that support Pythonistas in the making, and Pythonistas migrating into Data Science!

**Please feel free to contribute to the repository with useful resources! You may also find us at our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mw7xjJ7b7s) to meet other learners, find co-developers or mentors, and engage in small study sessions!**

## 🐍 Python Mastery

### ❓ Where to Start!
If you're serious about starting your journey as a Pythonista, then you need to start with the basics. As a first approach to the language, we suggest that you start with the book ["How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3"](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/howtothink/latest/howtothink.pdf) and follow up with the exercises presented in ["Python By Example: Learning to Program in 150 Challenges"](https://library.samdu.uz/download/10759). **All exercises in the latter book have solutions**, so it could be a nice way for you to start practicing. 

If you feel up to it, and to keep yourself in check, you can **contribute with exercises and solutions** that you come up with to this repository. Just make sure to follow the structure under `python-mastery` and add your exercise and `solution.py`, or add a new version of a solution in case the exercise already exists and you think your solution is different from the one(s) presented (e.g. `solution-03.py`).
