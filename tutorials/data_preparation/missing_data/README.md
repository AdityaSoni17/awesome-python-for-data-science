# Missing Data
Missing Data consists of the existence of absent values in a dataset and is a common obstacle that data scientists face in real-world domains. Missing data can occur in a variety of applications, for several different reasons, and regardless of whatever they might be, missing data has serious implications for knowledge extraction and classification performance. 

For that reason, **handling missing data** is one important step in **Data Preparation**.
