#### ⭐️ Contributing
To contribute, create a new folder inside the respective structure. Use the naming established: e.g., folder `ex0101` is Exercise 01.01 of folder `01` (01-the-basics). For each folder, there should be the **description of the exercise** (`README.md`) and the **respective solution** (`solution.py`). If there are more solutions to a given problem, you can submit them as `solution-02.py`, `solution-03.py`, etc.
